# Localization-using-AMCL
In this project, I learned to utilize ROS AMCL package to accurately localize a mobile robot inside a map in the Gazebo simulation environments.

steps involved in developing this project
<ul>
<li>Create a ROS package that launches a custom robot model in a custom Gazebo world
<li>Utilize the ROS AMCL package and the Tele-Operation / Navigation Stack to localize the robot
<li>Explore, add, and tune specific parameters corresponding to each package to achieve the best possible localization results</ul>
